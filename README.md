# Silver Floating Point

Notes about floating point arithmetic.


Currently interested in applications of low-precision arthimetic to scientific computing.   Looking for a floating point implementation to simulate low precision plus a math library with elementary functions.


## Arbitrary (large) precision
* GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library) https://gmplib.org/
* MPFR https://www.mpfr.org/

## Arbitrary (small) precision
* QPyTorch https://github.com/Tiiiger/QPyTorch
* FlexFloat (C library) https://github.com/oprecomp/flexfloat  or FloatX (C++ headers) https://github.com/oprecomp/FloatX

## Stochastic rounding
